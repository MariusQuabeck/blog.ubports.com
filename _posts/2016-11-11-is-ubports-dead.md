We've been seeing a lot of questions on places like reddit.com/r/ubuntu asking if Ubuntu Touch or UBPorts are dead. We're here to answer that once and for all.

No.

Anyway...

It's been a busy couple of weeks here at UBPorts. We've been trying our hardest to get a Nexus 5 devel build out the door and we need that to boot and work fine. We're very close, so stay tuned.

There has also been a good amount of work done on the OPO and FP2 but not much publicly has been said.

You might ask, "Why is it taking so long?" Well, my good eager beaver, it's because UBPorts switched to using CyanogenMod 12.1 instead of Android 4.4.2 as its base. As we manage to get it stable, it will hopefully enable more devices (all of them that have CyanogenMod 12.1 builds and a willing developer).

There has also been a lot going on prepairing for the soon to come ubucon, which, if all goes to plan, should be a very exciting even for ubports.

I've been working on documentation for various parts of the project and all of that work is going into the [UBPorts Wiki](https://wiki.ubports.com). I'm trying to detail parts of the porting process that are frequently asked about in our IRC. If you have anything that you'd like to contribute, please feel free to add it to the Wiki!

And I'll end today with a call to action: if you own the Nexus 5X and are willing to help the porting effort, be sure to check [this page](https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/Nexus-5X-Developer-Information) out! Of course, if you have any other device and a will to work with us, we will certainly welcome you!

From the community, we also have some videos from a user showing off the [FairPhone 2](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf7MNr0xlN6g36HNiXrvLmw)

Thanks for reading. Hopefully I'll get better at writing these posts eventually.
