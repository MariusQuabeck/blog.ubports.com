### Calling for Beta Testers

Today we are pushing out a new OTA to `devel_rc-proposed` for the Nexus 5, followed by the OnePlus One and the FairPhone 2 soon after, this is for people to test the software, so don't expect anything incredibly stable, we do expect this build to not be far from stable though, but we'd rather be safe then sorry, to make sure the software is up to par it will only leave `devel_rc-proposed` after 3 people confirm that it's working to a high enough standard, so if you are a tester, please go install `devel_rc-proposed`, fill in this [document](http://people.ubuntu.com/~mariogrip/Ubuntu-touch/UbportsQATesting5.1.pdf) and email it to ubports@lists.launchpad.net
